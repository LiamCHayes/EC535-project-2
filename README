In order to run this code, clone this repo on the vlsi lab computers with the EC535 directory sourced. Go into the km folder and make, and go into the ul folder and make. Now you will have meteor_km.ko and meteor executables. Load these two executables onto a BeagleBone with the LCD screen and a SparkFun 9-DOF IMU on the I2C pins. Clear the screen with `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fb0`, make the device file with `mknod /dev/meteor_dash c 61 0`, and install the module with `insmod meteor_km.ko`. Now you can run the userspace program to start the game with a 1-10 argument to start at a specific difficulty. To start at level 1, run `./meteor 1`.
